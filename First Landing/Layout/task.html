<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Before starting directly to build the project always try to build a basic schema in your head about how your project will look and what it will comprise or you can also use some drawing tools that are available on the internet.</p>
<p>For this project, let's start with the basic layout of our landing page. At first, the whole webpage or let's say the landing page is divided into 3 parts: <strong>Header</strong>, <strong>Main</strong>, <strong>and Footer</strong>. You need to divide the HTML body into these three parts. The <code class="java">header</code> tag contains the navbar of the landing page, the <code class="java">main</code> tag contains the main content of the landing page, and the <code class="java">footer</code> tag contains the footer of the landing page.</p>
<p>Now, let's set the <code class="java">height</code> of our body and then the height of the sections i.e. header, main, and footer of our landing page. You have to set the maximum height of the body to <code class="java">100%</code> of the viewable screen's height. Make sure to use the <code class="java">vh</code> unit while setting the height of the body.</p>
<p>Select the <code class="java">header</code>, <code class="java">main</code>, and <code class="java">footer</code> and set their minimum height to <code class="java">10%</code>, <code class="java">60%</code> and <code class="java">30%</code> of the viewable screen's height. Here also, you need to use the <code class="java">vh</code> unit to set their sizes.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Because the viewport height of the devices may not be the same so we cannot use the absolute units therefore prefer to use the <code class="java">vh</code> unit in this project.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, you should have created the following in your first landing webpage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divide the webpage into three parts i.e. <strong>Header</strong>, <strong>Main</strong>, <strong>and Footer </strong>and the order of the division should be the same as mentioned here.</li>
<li>The maximum height of the body tag and the minimum height of the header, main and footer tag should be set as per the above-mentioned rules.</li>
</ul>
