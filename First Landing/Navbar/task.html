<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Our first landing page now has a basic layout. In this stage, you are going to add a Navbar to your webpage.</p>
<p>As you already know, the navbar is present inside the <code class="java">header</code> tag. Let's start adding the <code class="java">nav</code> tag inside the <code class="java">header</code> tag. The navbar contains four anchor elements i.e. four hyperlinks and all four have different <code class="java">id</code> attributes as given below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">link_logo</code></li>
<li><code class="java">link_home</code></li>
<li><code class="java">link_product</code></li>
<li><code class="java">link_contact</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first link having the id as <code class="java">link_logo</code> goes to the <em>home</em> section which has an id as <code class="java">home</code> and you are going to create this section in the next stage. For now, link the first anchor tag to the <code class="java">home</code>. This anchor tag also contains an image that will be the logo of your webpage. The image should have a fixed width of <code class="java">64</code> and height of <code class="java">64</code> . Don't forget to add the <code class="java">title</code> and <code class="java">alt</code> attributes to improve the accessibility of your webpage.</p>
<p>The second anchor tag having the id as <code class="java">link_home</code> also goes to the <em>home</em> section. The third and fourth anchor tag having the id as <code class="java">link_product</code> and <code class="java">link_contact</code> goes to the <em>product</em> and <em>contact</em> section which will be created in the next stages. The texts for all these three anchor tags (second, third and fourth) must be Home, Product, and Contact respectively.</p>
<p>Let's set the maximum width of the <code class="java">nav</code> tag to <code class="java">100%</code> and as you know to align the content of the nav in a horizontal direction you have to set the display of the nav tag to <code class="java">flex</code> with the items wrapped.</p>
<p>For the navbar, you can add the paddings and margins to create the space you like. You can also change the color of the links and remove the text decoration if you want to as given in the example below.</p>
